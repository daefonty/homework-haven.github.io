 <br> My name is Deana Fontenelle, a 13 year old girl from the island of
Saint Lucia.There I attend the St.Joseph's Convent where I have
gotten the opportunity to explore so many of my interests. I love WRITING, PHOTOGRAPHY, and PLAYING NETBALL. I also really
enjoy CODING AND EDITING ANstanding firm on problems that I think
need CHANGE.

<div class="start"> THE SIMPLE STORY BEHIND H-H: </div> <br> <p class="myself"> As a student I realised that so many of us lack support and assistance when doing homework assignments and this can lead to poor quality work, bad grades and late submissions.Sometimes we rely on apps to help us  out of these difficult situations but finding the right app, can be so time consuming because there are so many options, and many of them are pricy. So, I created a website which does the job for you and provides access to only the most efficient, affordable and helpful educational apps for every subject. All of these are in one place so students don't have to go searching, which makes the process fast, and students go on to do the real work.
 I also know the mental impact stress from tedious assignments can cause , so this website serves as a haven where you can find pockets of motivation and  memes to help you keep going. </p>
